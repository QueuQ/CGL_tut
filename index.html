## Abstract
Over the past years, deep learning on graphs has made significant progress in various areas. However, most graph learning tasks assume graphs are static, while real-world graphs may constantly grow or evolve. Therefore, it is crucial to study how to constantly adapt a graph learning model to new patterns/tasks over graphs without forgetting the previously learned knowledge. To this end, in this tutorial, we will introduce the newly emerging area of continual graph learning (CGL). Specifically, we will (1) introduce different continual graph learning settings, (2) present the key challenges in CGL, (3) highlight the existing CGL techniques, and (4) discuss future directions.
The length of this tutorial will be 2 hours, including a 100 minutes presentation and 20 minutes Q$\&$A.
